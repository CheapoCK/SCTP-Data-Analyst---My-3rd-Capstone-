Phase Analysis: The dashboard shows each Phase, helping to identify patterns in the number of applicants, vacancies, over-subscribed schools, and highest/lowest application towns/schools.
Conclusion: Overall, the MOE Primary 1 Registration Phases Dashboard provides valuable insights for parents who are navigating the Phasesâ€™ details. The visualizations and key insights help to make sense of the complex data and provide a clear understanding of the Phases.

### Data Collection, Transformation, Cleaning
Data Extraction: The MOE Primary 1 Registration Phases Dashboard was created using a raw dataset from the "Kiasu Parents" website, which was initially in jpeg format. To extract the relevant data, OCR software such as [Nanonets](https://nanonets.com/blog/table-extraction-deep-learning/) and [Text_Grab](https://github.com/TheJoeFin/Text-Grab) were used. However, due to the poor resolution of the original jpeg files, the OCR software was only able to capture 10%-20% of the data accurately. As a result, the available data had to be manually entered into Excel and saved in CSV format to ensure accuracy and completeness.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: In Excel, data cleanings such as removing unwanted rows and columns were performed to ensure that only relevant data was included. In Power BI, data cleaning/transforming involved adding new columns and new calculations, also called measures. These measures were used to derive new insights and create additional visualizations.
